# My React App

This is a simple React application.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```

## File Descriptions

- `public/index.html`: The main HTML file that is served when someone visits your site. It includes a div with the id "root", which is the entry point for your React application.

- `src/components/App.js`: The main React component for your application. It is the root of your component hierarchy.

- `src/App.css`: Contains the CSS styles for your `App` component.

- `src/index.js`: The JavaScript file that renders your `App` component into the "root" div in your `index.html` file.

- `src/index.css`: Contains the global CSS styles for your application.

- `package.json`: Used by npm to store metadata for projects and modules. It includes things like the project name, version, description, and dependencies.

- `package-lock.json`: An automatically generated file that is used to lock down the versions of a project's dependencies so that you can control exactly which versions are used.
